      <p className="text-lg mb-2">
        Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining good health and overall
        well-being. It is the process of obtaining and consuming essential
        nutrients from food that our bodies need to function properly.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-2">
        Food is composed of various macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and
        fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). These nutrients
        provide energy, support growth and development, and help regulate bodily
        functions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-2">
        Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy, while proteins
        are essential for building and repairing tissues. Fats provide energy
        and help absorb certain vitamins. Vitamins and minerals are necessary
        for various bodily functions, such as maintaining a strong immune system
        and supporting bone health.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-2">
        It is important to maintain a balanced diet that includes a variety of
        nutrient-rich foods. This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
        lean proteins, and healthy fats. By consuming a diverse range of foods,
        we can ensure that our bodies receive all the necessary nutrients for
        optimal health.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Remember, nutrition is not just about what we eat, but also about how we
        eat. It is important to practice mindful eating, listen to our bodies'
        hunger and fullness cues, and make conscious choices about the foods we
        consume.
